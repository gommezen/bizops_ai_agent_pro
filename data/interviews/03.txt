Our executives want a concise weekly report: revenue run-rate, new signups, churn, upsell opportunities, and a short risks/notes section. Today this takes hours, partly because extracts from the data warehouse require manual cleanup. Ideally, weâ€™d automate the export, run data validation rules, and render a single HTML/PDF report. Over time, add anomaly detection so spikes in cancellations or support contacts are flagged automatically. Long term, we also want a roadmap for finance automation: less data entry, more decision support.
