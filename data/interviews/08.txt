For KPIs, we care about churn rate, NPS, time-to-insight for ad-hoc questions, and report latency. Moving from monthly to weekly reports would be a quick win. We also want a shared glossary so teams interpret metrics the same way. Eventually weâ€™ll experiment with propensity models for churn and upsell, but only after data quality and reporting are stable.
