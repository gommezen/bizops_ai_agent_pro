Most of our time is still spent on manual accounting tasks. People jump between spreadsheets and our ERP to reconcile invoices. We make mistakes when copying amounts and dates, which delays month-end. Leadership keeps asking for a weekly performance snapshot, but it’s hard to compile fast. If we automate the basic checks and standardize the report layout, finance could spend more time on analysis. We also want a lightweight forecasting model for monthly revenue and churn. Right now we guess based on last month’s trend. A phased plan would help: start with data quality checks, then rolling weekly reports, and only then the forecasting pilot.
