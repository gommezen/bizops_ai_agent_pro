There’s no single source of truth. Customer IDs differ between CRM and the billing system, so merges are messy. Support tickets are tracked, but the categories are inconsistent, which makes analysis noisy. We’d like a dashboard with: active customers, churn risk, ticket backlog, and NPS trend. Standardized definitions would reduce confusion. For churn, we suspect late invoices, low product usage, and multiple tickets in 90 days are strong signals. If we can predict churn reliably, we can intervene with customer success before it happens.
